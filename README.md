# BasicCalculator 

#### A basic calculator app for Android written in Java.

It's my very first Android project and its main goal was to familiarize myself with Android Studio and learn basics of Android developement.
Contains no ads or unnecessary permissions. 

## Interface
It has a very basic UI with pastel colours.

The icon is adaptive so will change accordingly to the user's settings.
