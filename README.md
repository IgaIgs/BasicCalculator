## Introduction

It's my very first Android project and its main goal was to familiarize myself with Android Studio and learn basics of Android developement.
Contains no ads or unnecessary permissions. 

## Interface
It has a very basic UI with pastel colours and a pleasant dark theme.

The icon is adaptive so will change accordingly to the user's settings. Here an example of the 'squircle' shape:

It also allows the user to perform multiple operations in a row:

As well as repeating operations by repeatedly using the "=" button.

## Launch
Since it is just a small project, the app has not yet been released to the Google Play store. For now it can be accessed by simply running it in Android Studio, either on a virtual device or on an external Android device.

#### To launch the app:
1) Download Android Studio IDE. You can get the latest version from this site: [https://developer.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
2) In the welcoming window of Android Studio, choose **Get from Version Control** to clone my repository containing this project.

3) Select **Version control: Git** and in the **URL:** bar paste this link: [https://github.com/IgaIgs/BasicCalculator.git](https://github.com/IgaIgs/BasicCalculator.git). Choose directory of your choice for the project to be saved to.

4) Once the project opens, choose the device you want the app to run on in the tool bar. 
  - Make sure the **Edit/Run Dialog** is set to *app*. 
  - Once you connect a remote Android device to your machine it will automatically appear on the list - in this case it's a Samsung device):

5) Wait till the project builds and, if you're using a remote device, installs the app.
6) Enjoy the app!

*DISCLAIMER:* When using a remote device, it's enough to do this **once only**. From then on, the app will stay installed on your Android device and you can use it just as any other app there. Of course you can also uninstall it as any other app.
